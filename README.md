*Unity 3D NFT Gallery*

//SDKs

I used ChainSafeSDK to fetch the NFT data from the Polygon network and used the Oculus Interaction SDK to interact with the objects. I personally like the Oculus SDK because of the Interaction with Hands. With this project as well I have added functionality of hands and controllers both. 

//Environment

Regarding the scene, I did not want to have a wall with 3 NFTs because that would just be a 180 degree experience and not a 6DoF and I always try to give that experience no matter how simple the scene is. A lot more could be done to improve it but this is what I was able to pull off.

//APK

This can be installed directly to the Quest 2 and you can have the experience inside the headset.
